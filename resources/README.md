## 🎓 Learning Tips

### Active Learning
- ✅ Code solutions yourself, don't just read
- ✅ Explain your approach out loud
- ✅ Draw diagrams for complex problems
- ✅ Discuss with peers

### Spaced Repetition
- 📅 Review problems after 1 day
- 📅 Review again after 1 week
- 📅 Review again after 1 month
- 📅 This helps with long-term retention

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand**: Read carefully, clarify inputs/outputs
2. **Example**: Work through examples manually
3. **Brute Force**: Think of simplest solution first
4. **Optimize**: Apply patterns, improve complexity
5. **Code**: Write clean, commented code
6. **Test**: Test with edge cases
7. **Analyze**: Discuss time/space complexity
