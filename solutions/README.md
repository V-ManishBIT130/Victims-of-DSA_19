# Solutions

This directory contains solutions to all problems in the Axiom 2025 DSA collection.

## 📁 Organization

Solutions are named using the format: `problem_name_solution.[extension]`

Example:
- `two_sum_solution.py` - Python solution for Two Sum problem
- `two_sum_solution.java` - Java solution for Two Sum problem
- `two_sum_solution.cpp` - C++ solution for Two Sum problem

## 🌐 Supported Languages

We provide solutions in multiple programming languages:

- 🐍 **Python**: `.py`
- ☕ **Java**: `.java`
- ⚡ **C++**: `.cpp`
- 📜 **JavaScript**: `.js`

## 📖 Solution Format

Each solution includes:

1. **Header Comment**: Problem name, approach, and complexity analysis
2. **Well-commented Code**: Clear explanations of the logic
3. **Test Cases**: Examples demonstrating the solution

### Example Structure (Python):

```python
"""
Problem: [Problem Name]
Approach: [Algorithm/Strategy Used]
Time Complexity: O(?)
Space Complexity: O(?)
Author: [Your Name]
"""

def solution_function():
    # Implementation
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test the solution
    pass
```

## 💡 Multiple Approaches

Some problems have multiple solution files showcasing different approaches:
- Brute force vs optimized
- Iterative vs recursive
- Different data structures

Look for files like:
- `problem_name_solution_approach1.py`
- `problem_name_solution_approach2.py`

## 🤝 Contributing Solutions
