# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Axiom 2025**! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## 🚀 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Understand the Repository
This repository contains:
- **Problems**: DSA challenges to solve
- **Solutions**: Reference implementations
- **Resources**: Learning guides and tutorials
- **Documentation**: Event and contribution information

### Step 2: Choose Your Path

#### 🟢 I'm a Beginner
1. Read [DSA Fundamentals](resources/fundamentals.md)
2. Start with the [Two Sum problem](problems/two_sum.md)
3. Study the [solution](solutions/two_sum_solution.py)
4. Try solving it yourself without looking at the solution

#### 🟡 I'm Intermediate
1. Review [Common Patterns](resources/patterns.md)
2. Browse [all problems](problems/README.md)
3. Try to solve problems without hints
4. Analyze time and space complexity

#### 🔴 I'm Advanced
1. Dive into hard problems
2. Optimize existing solutions
3. Contribute new problems
4. Help others in discussions

### Step 3: Start Practicing

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/V-ManishBIT130/Victims-of-DSA_19.git
cd Victims-of-DSA_19

# Pick a problem from the problems/ directory
# Try to solve it
# Check the solution in solutions/ directory
# Run the solution to test
python3 solutions/two_sum_solution.py
```

### Step 4: Track Your Progress

Create a personal checklist:
- [ ] Solve 10 easy problems
- [ ] Solve 5 medium problems
- [ ] Master 3 coding patterns
- [ ] Contribute 1 solution
- [ ] Help 1 person in discussion

## 💡 Problem-Solving Template

Use this template when solving problems:

```python
"""
1. UNDERSTAND
   - What is the problem asking?
   - What are the inputs and outputs?
   - What are the constraints?

2. EXAMPLES
   - Work through examples manually
   - Consider edge cases

3. APPROACH
   - Brute force solution first
   - Can we optimize?
   - What pattern fits?

4. CODE
   - Write clean, commented code
   - Use meaningful variable names

5. TEST
   - Test with examples
   - Test edge cases

6. ANALYZE
   - Time complexity: O(?)
   - Space complexity: O(?)
"""

def solution():
    # Your code here
    pass
```
